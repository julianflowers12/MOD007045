The assessments are based on the available evidence for the target group of species for each intervention. The assessment may therefore refer to different species or habitat to the one(s) you are considering. Before making any decisions about implementing interventions it is vital that you read the more detailed accounts of the evidence in order to assess their relevance for your study species or system.Full details of the evidence are available at<ref target="https://www.conservationevidence.com">
               <hi rendition="simple:bold">www.conservationevidence.com</hi>
            </ref>There may also be significant negative side-effects on the target groups or other species or communities that have not been identified in this assessment.A lack of evidence means that we have been unable to assess whether or not an intervention is effective or has any harmful impacts.<div>

One before-and-after study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements despite the involvement of local communities in the reintroduction project, alongside other interventions. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: unknown effectiveness &#8212; limited evidence (effectiveness 50%; certainty 20%; harms 0%).</hi>
