The assessments are based on the available evidence for the target group of species for each intervention. The assessment may therefore refer to different species or habitat to the one(s) you are considering. Before making any decisions about implementing interventions it is vital that you read the more detailed accounts of the evidence in order to assess their relevance for your study species or system.Full details of the evidence are available at<ref target="http://www.conservationevidence.com/">

            </ref>There may also be significant negative side-effects on the target groups or other species or communities that have not been identified in this assessment.A lack of evidence means that we have been unable to assess whether or not an intervention is effective or has any harmful impacts.<div>

Six of seven studies, including three replicated studies, in Canada, Europe and the USA found that installing culverts or tunnels decreased amphibian road deaths. One found no effect on road deaths. Fifteen of 24 studies, including one review, in Australia, Canada, Europe and the USA found that tunnels were used by amphibians. Four found mixed effects depending on species, site or culvert type. Five found that culverts were not used or were used by less than 10% of amphibians. Six studies, including one replicated, controlled study, in Canada, Europe and the USA investigated the use of culverts with flowing water. Two found that they were used by amphibians. Three found that they were rarely or not used.

Five found mixed effects and one found that abundance was higher with riparian buffers.

Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found that the removal of coarse woody debris from standing forest did not affect amphibian diversity or overall amphibian abundance, but did reduce species richness. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that within clearcut forest, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher within piles of woody debris than in open areas. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: trade-offs between benefits and harms (effectiveness 40%; certainty 60%; harms 26%).</hi>

                  <ref target="http://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/869">Create ponds (amphibians in general)</ref>Twenty-eight studies investigated the colonization of created ponds by amphibians in general, all of which found that amphibians used all or some of the created ponds. Five of nine studies in Australia, Canada, Spain, the UK and USA found that numbers of species were similar or higher in created compared to natural ponds. Nine studies in Europe and the USA found that amphibians established stable populations, used or reproduced in created ponds. Four found that species composition differed, and abundance, juvenile productivity or size in created ponds depended on species. One study found that numbers of species were similar or lower in created ponds. Sixteen studies in Europe and the USA found that created ponds were used or colonized by up to 15 naturally colonizing species, up to 10 species that reproduced or by captive-bred amphibians. Five studies in Europe and the USA found that pond creation, with restoration in three cases, maintained and increased populations or increased species. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: beneficial (effectiveness 80%; certainty 80%; harms 0%).</hi>

Seven found mixed results, with some species or populations reproducing successfully, but with other species difficult to maintain or raise to adults.

Two found mixed results with breeding populations established in 71% of studies reviewed or at 50% of sites. Two found that head-started metamorphs or adults did not establish a breeding population or prevent a population decline. An additional 10 studies in Australia, Canada, Europe and the USA measured aspects of survival or breeding success of released head-started amphibians and found mixed results.

               <ref target="http://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/760">Engage volunteers to collect amphibian data (citizen science)</ref>Five studies in Canada, the UK and USA found that amphibian data collection projects engaged up to 10,506 volunteers and were active in 16&#8211;17 states in the USA. Five studies in the UK and USA found that volunteers surveyed up to 7,872 sites, swabbed almost 6,000 amphibians and submitted thousands of amphibian records. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: likely to be beneficial (effectiveness 66%; certainty 60%; harms 0%).</hi>

               <ref target="http://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/776">Provide education programmes about amphibians</ref>One study in Taiwan found that education programmes about wetlands and amphibians, along with other interventions, doubled a population of Taipei frogs. Four studies, including one replicated study, in Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, Zimbabwe and the USA found that education programmes increased the amphibian knowledge of students. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: likely to be beneficial (effectiveness 58%; certainty 55%; harms 0%).</hi>

               <ref target="http://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/831">Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information</ref>Two studies, including one replicated, before-and-after study, in Estonia and the UK found that raising public awareness, along with other interventions, increased amphibian breeding habitat and numbers of toads. One before-and-after study in Mexico found that raising awareness in tourists increased their knowledge of axolotls. However, one study in Taiwan found that holding press conferences had no effect on a frog conservation project. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: likely to be beneficial (effectiveness 60%; certainty 51%; harms 0%).</hi>
