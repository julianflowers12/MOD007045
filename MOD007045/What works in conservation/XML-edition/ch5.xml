The assessments are based on the available evidence for the target habitat for each intervention. The assessment may therefore refer to different habitat to the one(s) you are considering. Before making any decisions about implementing interventions it is vital that you read the more detailed accounts of the evidence in order to assess their relevance for your study species or system.Full details of the evidence are available at<ref target="http://www.conservationevidence.com">
               <hi rendition="simple:bold">www.conservationevidence.com</hi>
            </ref>There may also be significant negative side-effects on the target habitats or other species or communities that have not been identified in this assessment.A lack of evidence means that we have been unable to assess whether or not an intervention is effective or has any harmful impacts.<div>

One study found it increased trees species richness and six found mixed or no effect or mixed effect on density, size, species richness or diversity. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Finland found that clearcutting decreased total forest biomass, particularly of evergreen shrubs.

One found it decreased young tree density and two found mixed or no effect. Eight of 12 studies, including three replicated, randomized, controlled studies, across the world found that clearcutting increased the cover or species richness of understory plants.

One of three studies, including two replicated, paired-sites, before-and-after studies, in Canada, Bhutan and Ireland found that excluding large herbivores increased the biomass of young trees. One found it decreased the density of young trees and one found mixed effects on species. Five of 10 studies, including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies, across the world found that excluding large herbivores increased the cover or and size of understory plants. Six found no effect on the cover, seed density, species richness or diversity of understory plants. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Assessment: likely to be beneficial (effectiveness 50%; certainty 65%; harms 10%).</hi>
